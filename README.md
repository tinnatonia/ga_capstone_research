## Notes:

### Linguistics: 
- some uncommon/non ASCII characters have to be dealt with
- will have to scrape from UNESCO for # of speakers
- data for revitalization (unsure if I can find it)
- [Grambank](https://grambank.clld.org/)
- [Glottolog](https://github.com/glottolog/glottolog/tree/master)
- [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/) - Cross-Linguistic Data Formats
- glotto has huge data set compared to gram, but lots of missing data - check this out

##### Data Cleaning:
###### Glottolog
- Nulls:
> Countries - drop - location data from lat/long
> Macroarea - drop - geo/political subdivisions, irrelevant
